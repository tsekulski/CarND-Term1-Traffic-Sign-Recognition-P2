# CarND-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-P2

_Technologies: Computer Vision, TensorFlow, Deep Learning_

The goal of this project was to design a deep neural network that correctly classifies German traffic sign images by allocating them to one of the 43 pre-defined classes.

Built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures. Performed image pre-processing and validation to guard against overfitting.
